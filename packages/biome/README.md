> Sharable config for [biome](https://biomejs.dev/)

## Using the config

Install with your preferred package manager as a devDependency.
Then export this package from your preferred [biome config file location](https://biomejs.dev/guides/configure-biome/#configuration-file-structure).
For simplicity, the below example assumes your config file is `biome.jsonc`.

```sh
echo "{\n  \"extends\": [\"@adambullmer/biome-config\"]\n}" > biome.jsonc
```
