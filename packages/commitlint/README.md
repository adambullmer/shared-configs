# commitlint

> Sharable config for [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/)

## Using the config

Install with your preferred package manager as a devDependency.
Then export this package from your preferred [commitlint config file location](https://commitlint.js.org/reference/configuration.html#config-via-file).
For simplicity, the below example assumes your config file is `commitlint.config.mjs`.

```sh
echo 'export { default as default } from "@adambullmer/commitlint-config";' > commitlint.config.mjs
```
